# COVID19-DTB: COVID-19 Discourse Dependency Treebank

COVID19-DTB is a collection of manually annotated discourse dependency structures for scholarly paper abstracts on COVID-19 and related coronaviruses like SARS and MERS.

The following figure shows an actual example of discourse dependency structure for an abstract ([Israeli et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.144196)) in COVID19-DTB.

## Description

First, we sampled 300 abstracts randomly from the 2020 September snapshot of [The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://allenai.org/data/cord-19).
Then, the 300 abstracts were segmented into Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) manually by the authors.
Then, we employed two professional annotators to give gold discourse dependency structures to the 300 abstracts independently.
We divided the results into development and test sets, each of which consists of 150 examples.

The further details on the annotation scheme, annotation procedure, and corpus statistics can be found in our paper.

## Data format

We follow the same JSON schema with [the SciDTB dataset (Yang and Li, 2018)](https://aclanthology.org/P18-2071): Each discourse dependency structure is stored as a JSON file like the following:

```
